# 2 XP Core Values that were followed
1. Simpicity

      a. Our project embraced the XP core value of **Simplicity** by focusing on essential functionalities and avoiding over-engineering.
   
      b. We prioritized crucial features such as viewing courses and managing student lists, and decided against implementing a complex feedback mechanism early in development to maintain clarity and manageability.
   
      c. Our development process was characterized by iterative development; this approach allowed us to continuously integrate feedback and refine our application with each cycle, greatly enhancing alignment with user needs and system requirements.
   
      d. Regular refactoring was integral to our workflow, helping us keep the codebase simple and maintainable by systematically improving the existing code and integrating new features seamlessly.
   
      e. Additionally, we employed a component reuse strategy across different user roles to ensure consistency in the user interface, reduce developmental redundancy, and facilitate easier maintenance and upgrades, thus adhering to the DRY principle and reinforcing the value of simplicity in our software engineering practices.

2. Communication

      In our project, we prioritized effective communication by instituting daily stand-up meetings as part of our Agile practice. Held via Google Meet at the same time each day, these 15-minute sessions required the active participation of all team members, ensuring consistent and efficient exchanges of information. Each team member shared their recent accomplishments, next steps, and any obstacles they faced, allowing for immediate identification and collaborative resolution of issues, significantly minimizing delays.

      The structure of these meetings was crucial in maintaining alignment with project goals, as they kept everyone informed about the project's current status and upcoming priorities. This routine not only facilitated prompt adjustments to our work plans based on new developments and insights but also strengthened team cohesion by fostering a sense of community and mutual accountability. Ultimately, our commitment to open and ongoing communication played a pivotal role in sustaining project momentum and achieving successful project delivery.
